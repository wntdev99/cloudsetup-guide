<Step number={2} title="Configure Build Settings">

Netlify will auto-detect your build settings based on your project. Review them:

1. **Base directory**: Usually blank (root of repo).
2. **Build command**:
   - React/Next.js: `npm run build`
   - Static HTML: Leave blank
   - Hugo: `hugo`
3. **Publish directory**:
   - React/Next.js: `out` or `build`
   - Static HTML: `public` or `.`
4. Click **Deploy site**.

<CopyBlock
  code="// Typical build settings for different frameworks:
// React: npm run build - Output: build
// Next.js: npm run build - Output: .next
// Hugo: hugo - Output: public
// Vue: npm run build - Output: dist
// Static HTML: (no build) - Output: . or public"

<Step number={3} title="Wait for Initial Deployment">

Netlify starts building your site automatically. You'll see:

1. **Build log** showing the deployment progress.
2. **Status** changes from "Building" to "Published".
3. Your **live URL** appears (e.g., `happy-kangaroo-123.netlify.app`).
4. Click the **live URL** to view your deployed site.

<Callout type="info">
⏳ **Build time**: First deployment takes 1-5 minutes depending on your project. Subsequent deployments are usually faster with caching.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step number={4} title="Test Automatic Deployments">

Now test that deployments work automatically:

1. Go back to your **GitHub repository**.
2. Make a **small change** to your code (e.g., change a title in HTML).
3. **Commit and push** to main branch:

<CopyBlock
  code="git add .
git commit -m 'Test automatic deployment'
git push origin main"
  language="bash"
/>

4. Go back to Netlify dashboard.
5. You should see a **new deployment started** automatically!
6. Wait for it to complete (1-2 minutes).
7. Refresh your live site - you'll see your changes!

<Step number={5} title="Configure Custom Domain and Production Settings">

1. Click **Domain settings** in your Netlify site dashboard.
2. (Optional) Click **Add custom domain** to use your own domain (mysite.com).
3. Update DNS records with your domain provider.
4. Netlify provides **free HTTPS** - enabled automatically.
5. Your site is now production-ready!

<Checkpoint
  title="Verify Continuous Deployment"
  items={[
    "Did your site deploy successfully?",
    "Can you access the live URL?",
    "Did automatic deployment trigger on your push?",
    "Are HTTPS and SSL enabled?"
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="success">
✅ **Complete!** Your site is now deployed on Netlify with automatic deployments from GitHub. Every push triggers a new deployment - no manual steps needed!
</Callout>

</Step>

## What's Next

1. **Add custom domain** - Point your domain to Netlify
2. **Set up environment variables** - Store API keys and secrets securely
3. **Enable branch deployments** - Preview pull requests before merging
4. **Configure redirects** - Set up URL rewrites and redirects

A. Every time you push to the main branch. Each push triggers a new build and deployment within seconds.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**Q. Can I test changes before deploying?**

A. Yes! Netlify creates **preview deployments** for pull requests. You can test your changes before merging to main.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### Build failed - needs npm dependencies

- Make sure `package.json` is in your repository root
- Ensure all dependencies are listed (npm install works locally)
- Check build logs for specific error messages

### Site shows 404 error after deploy

- Verify your publish directory is correct
- Check that the build output directory exists
- For React/Next.js, confirm build command ran successfully

### Automatic deployment didn't trigger

- Verify GitHub integration is still authorized
- Check that you pushed to the correct branch (main/master)
- Look at "Deploys" tab for push event history
- Try manually triggering deployment: click "Trigger deploy"

### HTTPS not working

- Wait a few minutes - SSL certificate generation takes time
- Go to Domain settings and check HTTPS status
- If manual domain, ensure DNS is pointing to Netlify

**Congratulations!** Your website is now deployed with continuous integration. Every push automatically updates your site! 🚀
