# Install and Setup Docker - Start Container Development

Docker is a tool that packages applications and their dependencies into standardized units called containers. Follow this guide to install Docker Desktop and run your first container!

## What is Docker?

<Callout type="info">
🐳 **Docker is a containerization platform**

Key features of Docker:
- **Environment consistency**: Run the same environment as development
- **Fast deployment**: Much faster startup than virtual machines
- **Resource efficiency**: Each container is lightweight and independent
- **Version control**: Precise version management through images
- **Scalability**: Easily manage multiple containers

Examples:
- `nodejs-app`: For Node.js applications
- `postgres-db`: For PostgreSQL database
- `nginx-server`: For Nginx web server
</Callout>

<Step number={1} title="Download Docker Desktop">

### macOS Installation

1. Visit [Docker official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Click the **Download for Mac** button at the top.
3. Select based on your Mac's CPU:
   - **Apple Silicon [M1/M2/M3]**: For newer Macs
   - **Intel Chip**: For older Macs

  priority={true}
/>

### Windows Installation

1. Click the **Download for Windows** button.
2. WSL 2 [Windows Subsystem for Linux] will be installed automatically.
3. Download the Docker Desktop installer file.

<Callout type="warning">
⚠️ **Windows Requirements**

- Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, Education or higher
- Or Windows 11
- Hyper-V support is required
</Callout>

### Linux Installation

1. Linux uses a different installation method.
2. Open a terminal and run these commands:

<CopyBlock
  code="curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh"
  language="bash"
/>

</Step>

---

<Step number={2} title="Install and Run Docker Desktop">

### macOS and Windows

1. Run the downloaded installer file.
2. Follow the installation process [takes about 2-3 minutes].
3. Once installation completes, find Docker in Applications and launch it.
4. Docker is running when the icon appears in your menu bar.

/>

<Callout type="tip">
💡 **Tip**: When you first run Docker, it will ask for your system password. Docker needs admin rights to use the Hypervisor [virtualization technology].
</Callout>

### Linux

After installation, docker commands are immediately available. To add your user to the docker group:

<CopyBlock
  code="sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker"
  language="bash"
/>

</Step>

---

<Step number={3} title="Verify Installation">

Open a terminal or command prompt and type:

<CopyBlock
  code="docker --version"
  language="bash"
/>

You should see output like:

<CopyBlock
  code="Docker version 24.0.0, build abcdef123"
  language="bash"
/>

For more detailed information:

<CopyBlock
  code="docker info"
  language="bash"
/>

This command shows Docker daemon status, container count, image count, and more.

<Checkpoint
  title="Verify Installation"
  items={[
    "Did the docker --version command run successfully?",
    "Is the version number displayed?",
    "Did you verify the status with docker info?"
  ]}
/>

</Step>

---

<Step number={4} title="Run Your First Container">

Let's run a Hello World container to verify installation:

<CopyBlock
  code="docker run hello-world"
  language="bash"
/>

If successful, you'll see output like:

<CopyBlock
  code="Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon
2. The Docker daemon pulled the hello-world image
3. The Docker daemon created a new container
4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client"
  language="bash"
/>

<Callout type="success">
✅ **Congratulations!** Docker is installed correctly and your first container ran successfully!
</Callout>

<DevTip>
**Docker Images and Containers Concept**

- **Image**: Template or blueprint for an application
- **Container**: Running instance of an image

Example:
- When you run the `hello-world` image, it creates a hello-world container
- You can create multiple containers from the same image
</DevTip>

</Step>

---

## After Installation - Verification Steps

### Check System Requirements Met

<CopyBlock
  code="docker ps
docker ps -a
docker images"
  language="bash"
/>

What each command does:
- `docker ps`: List of running containers
- `docker ps -a`: List of all containers [including stopped ones]
- `docker images`: List of installed images

### Docker Hub Login [Optional]

To share images later, create a Docker Hub account and login:

<CopyBlock
  code="docker login"
  language="bash"
/>

---

## Next Steps

Docker installation is complete, now let's get started:

1. **[Docker Build and Deploy](../docker-build-deploy)** - Create containers yourself
2. **[Deploy Heroku App](../heroku-app-deployment)** - Deploy containers to the cloud

---

## Platform-Specific Additional Setup

### macOS - Rosetta 2 [Apple Silicon]

To run Intel-based images on Apple Silicon Mac:

<CopyBlock
  code="docker run --platform linux/amd64 [image-name]"
  language="bash"
/>

### Windows - Verify WSL 2

Check if you're using WSL 2 on Windows:

<CopyBlock
  code="wsl --version"
  language="bash"
/>

Or in Docker Desktop settings:
- Click **Settings** [gear icon]
- Go to **Resources**
- Check **WSL Integration**

## Frequently Asked Questions

<Callout type="info">
**Q. Is Docker really free?**

A. Yes, Docker Community Edition is completely free. You can use it without limits.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**Q. What's the difference between Docker and virtual machines?**

A. Docker uses OS-level virtualization, making it much faster and lighter than virtual machines.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**Q. Can I run all images on M1/M2 Macs?**

A. Most work, but some Intel-only images need emulation with the --platform flag.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to Docker daemon"

- Verify Docker Desktop is running
- Check the menu bar for the Docker icon on Mac/Windows
- Try restarting Docker

### "Permission denied while trying to connect to Docker daemon" [Linux]

- Add user to docker group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
- Restart your terminal or run `newgrp docker`

### Windows: "WSL 2 installation is incomplete"

- Run Windows PowerShell as administrator
- Run `wsl --install`
- Restart your system
