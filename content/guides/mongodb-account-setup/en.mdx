<DevTip>
The M0 cluster is shared infrastructure. For production apps with high traffic, upgrade to paid M10 cluster. But M0 is great for development, learning, and MVP testing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<Callout type="info">
**Q. What's the difference between MongoDB and SQL databases?**

A. MongoDB stores flexible JSON documents (NoSQL), while SQL databases use rigid tables. MongoDB is better for flexible schemas and rapid development. SQL is better for strict data structures and complex joins.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**Q. How much can I store on the free tier?**

A. 512 MB of data. This is enough for development, testing, and small projects. Once you run out, you can upgrade to a paid tier or delete old data.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**Q. Can I use MongoDB for production?**

A. Yes! MongoDB Atlas is used by thousands of production apps. The free M0 tier is best for development. For production traffic, upgrade to paid tiers (M10, M20, etc.).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**Q. What if I lose my password?**

A. You can reset your password in MongoDB Atlas under Database Access. Create a new user with a new password and delete the old one.

## Troubleshooting

### Verification email not received

- Check spam/junk folder
- Wait a few minutes for email delivery
- Click "Resend verification email" on signup page
- Try signing up again with a different email

### Cluster creation is slow

- Cluster provisioning can take 1-3 minutes
- Don't refresh the page - wait for it to complete
- If stuck over 5 minutes, try refreshing the page

### Can't connect to database

- Verify your connection string is correct
- Check that network access is allowed
- Ensure your database user exists and password is correct
- For production, configure IP whitelist instead of allowing anywhere

**Great!** Your MongoDB database is ready. Next, set up your first database and start storing data! 🚀
