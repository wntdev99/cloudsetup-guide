## Frequently Asked Questions

<Callout type="info">
**Q. Is Hugging Face really free?**

A. Yes! Core features are completely free. Premium services like commercial model hosting and priority inference are paid.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**Q. Can I use Hugging Face models commercially?**

A. Depends on the model's license. Most models have MIT or Apache 2.0 licenses allowing commercial use. Check each model's card for license info.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**Q. How do I download models locally?**

A. Use the Hugging Face `transformers` library:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("model-name")
```

This downloads the model to your machine for offline use.
