Vercel is the company behind Next.js and provides the best deployment platform for frontend frameworks. This guide walks you through creating a Vercel account with your GitHub account, exploring the dashboard, and understanding the free Hobby plan benefits.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- GitHub account (create one for free at [github.com](https://github.com) if you don't have one)
- Email address
- Web browser

<Callout type="info">
While Vercel supports GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket sign-in, we recommend using GitHub for the best integration experience with Next.js.

<Step number={1} title="Visit Vercel Website and Sign Up with GitHub">

1. Open your web browser and navigate to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com).

<Step number={2} title="GitHub OAuth Authentication and Permission Grant">

1. When the GitHub login page appears, enter your GitHub username and password.
2. Click the **Authorize Vercel** button to grant Vercel access to your GitHub account.
3. Review the requested permissions:
   - Read repository access
   - Webhook creation (for automatic deployments)
   - Commit status updates

<Callout type="warning">
During authorization, you can choose "Grant access to all repositories" or "Only select repositories". We recommend starting with selected repositories only.
</Callout>

<Checkpoint>

<Step number={3} title="Choose Account Type (Personal vs Team)">

After GitHub authentication, Vercel will ask you to choose an account type.

### Personal Account
- Perfect for personal and side projects
- Free Hobby plan access
- Single user access
- Unlimited deployments

### Team Account
- Designed for collaborative projects
- Invite multiple team members
- Starts with Pro plan (paid)
- Role-based access control

**We recommend starting with a Personal Account (Hobby Plan) for beginners.**

1. Select **Continue with Personal Account**.
2. (Optional) Set your account name. Default is your GitHub username.

<DevTip title="When You Need a Team Account">
You can create a team anytime from settings later. It's better to start with a personal account and upgrade to a team when collaboration is needed.
</DevTip>

</Step>

Once account creation is complete, you'll be redirected to the Vercel dashboard.

3. **Storage**: Access to Vercel KV, Postgres, and Blob storage
