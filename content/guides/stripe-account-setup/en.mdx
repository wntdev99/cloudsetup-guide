## Troubleshooting

### My phone verification code isn't working

- Make sure you're entering the code within the time limit (usually 10 minutes)
- Check for extra spaces in the code
- Request a new code if it expired

### Bank verification is taking too long

- Stripe makes two small test deposits to your account (1-2 business days)
- Once you see them, you need to confirm the amounts in your Stripe Dashboard
- If deposits don't arrive within 2 weeks, contact Stripe Support

### Account shows Limited Functionality

- Stripe may require additional verification documents
- Check your Stripe Dashboard for requests
- You can still process test payments while this is pending
