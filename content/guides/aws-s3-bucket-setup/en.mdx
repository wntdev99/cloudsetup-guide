# Create and Configure AWS S3 Bucket

AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable object storage service used for file storage, backups, static website hosting, and more. This guide walks you through creating an S3 bucket and configuring basic settings step by step.

<FreeTierInfo />

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features of S3">
- **Durability**: 99.999999999% (11 nines) data durability
- **Scalability**: Unlimited storage capacity
- **Storage Classes**: Standard, IA, Glacier for cost optimization
- **Security**: Encryption, access control, and versioning support
</Callout>

<PrerequisiteCheck prerequisites={["aws-account-setup", "aws-iam-user-create"]} />

<Step number={1} title="Navigate to S3 Service">

Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.

1. Type **"S3"** in the search bar at the top of the AWS Management Console
2. Click **S3** from the search results

/>

<Checkpoint>
Are you on the S3 dashboard? You should see a bucket list and a "Create bucket" button.
</Checkpoint>

</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Create a New S3 Bucket">

Create your first S3 bucket.

1. Click the **"Create bucket"** button
2. Enter a **Bucket name** (must be globally unique)
   - Example: `my-app-storage-2026` (lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only)
   - Must be DNS-compatible (3-63 characters)
3. Select **AWS Region**
   - For Korean users: **"Asia Pacific (Seoul) ap-northeast-2"** recommended
4. Keep the remaining settings as default
5. Click **"Create bucket"** at the bottom of the page

  alt="S3 bucket creation screen"
  caption="Set bucket name and region"
/>

<Callout type="warning" title="Bucket Naming Rules">
- Bucket names must be globally unique
- Use only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens (-)
- Cannot use IP address format (192.168.1.1)
- Names cannot be changed, so choose carefully
</Callout>

<DevTip title="Region Selection Tips">
Choose a region close to your users to minimize data latency. Seoul region (ap-northeast-2) provides the best performance for Korean users.
</DevTip>

</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Upload Files">

Upload files to your newly created bucket.

1. Click on the bucket you just created from the bucket list
2. Click the **"Upload"** button
3. Click **"Add files"** or **"Add folder"**
4. Select files to upload (e.g., images, PDFs, HTML files)
5. (Optional) Select **Storage class**
   - **S3 Standard**: Frequently accessed data (default)
   - **S3 Standard-IA**: Infrequently accessed data (cost savings)
   - **S3 Glacier**: Archive data (lowest cost)
6. Click **"Upload"** at the bottom of the page

<Screenshot
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/v1/guides/aws-s3-bucket-setup/step3-upload-file-en.png"
  alt="S3 file upload screen"
  caption="Select files and specify storage class"
/>

<Checkpoint>
Did the files upload successfully? You should be able to see the uploaded files in the bucket's object list.
</Checkpoint>

<DevTip title="Large File Uploads">
For files larger than 100MB, using AWS CLI or SDK is more efficient. You can use multipart upload for reliable large file transfers.

```bash
# Upload file with AWS CLI
aws s3 cp large-file.zip s3://my-app-storage-2026/

# Sync entire folder
aws s3 sync ./local-folder s3://my-app-storage-2026/backup/
```
</DevTip>

</Step>

<Step number={4} title="Configure Bucket Permissions and Public Access">

Set access permissions for your files.

### Unblock Public Access (only if needed)

1. Click the **"Permissions"** tab on the bucket page
2. Click **"Edit"** in the **"Block public access"** section
3. Unblock as needed (required for static website hosting)
4. Enter confirmation text and click **"Confirm"**

### Make Individual Files Public

1. Select a file from the **"Objects"** tab in the bucket
2. Click **"Actions"** → **"Make public using ACL"**

<Screenshot
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/v1/guides/aws-s3-bucket-setup/step4-permissions-en.png"
  alt="S3 bucket permissions settings"
  caption="Manage public access block settings"
/>

<Callout type="danger" title="Security Warning">
Public access allows anyone to access your files. Never make buckets with sensitive data public. Use bucket policies or presigned URLs when necessary.
</Callout>

<DevTip title="Fine-grained Access Control with Bucket Policies">
Use bucket policies to allow access only under specific conditions.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-app-storage-2026/public/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

This policy allows public read access only to files in the `public/` folder.
</DevTip>

</Step>

<Step number={5} title="Enable Static Website Hosting">

Host a static website using S3.

1. Click the **"Properties"** tab on the bucket page
2. Find the **"Static website hosting"** section at the bottom
3. Click **"Edit"**
4. Select **"Enable"**
5. **Hosting type**: Select **"Host a static website"**
6. Enter **Index document**: `index.html`
7. (Optional) Enter **Error document**: `error.html`
8. Click **"Save changes"**
9. Copy the generated **Bucket website endpoint** URL

<Screenshot
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/v1/guides/aws-s3-bucket-setup/step5-static-website-en.png"
  alt="S3 static website hosting settings"
  caption="Enable static website hosting"
/>

<Checkpoint>
Does the index.html file display when you access the website endpoint URL?
</Checkpoint>

<DevTip title="Sample index.html">
Test index.html file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>My S3 Website</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>AWS S3 Static Website Hosting Success!</h1>
  <p>This page is served from an S3 bucket.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Upload this file to your bucket and access it via the website endpoint.
</DevTip>

</Step>

<Step number={6} title="Configure Lifecycle Rules (Cost Optimization)">

Automatically delete old files or move them to cheaper storage classes.

1. Click the **"Management"** tab on the bucket page
2. Click **"Create lifecycle rule"** in the **"Lifecycle rules"** section
3. Enter **Lifecycle rule name** (e.g., `auto-archive-old-files`)
4. Select **Rule scope**:
   - Apply to all objects or specific prefix/tags
5. Select **Lifecycle rule actions**:
   - **"Transition current versions of objects"**: Move to Standard-IA after 30 days
   - **"Expire current versions of objects"**: Delete after 90 days
6. Click **"Create rule"**

<Screenshot
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/v1/guides/aws-s3-bucket-setup/step6-lifecycle-en.png"
  alt="S3 lifecycle rule settings"
  caption="Optimize storage costs with lifecycle rules"
/>

<Callout type="tip" title="Cost Optimization Strategies">
- Infrequently accessed log files: Move to Standard-IA after 30 days
- Archive backups: Move to Glacier after 90 days
- Temporary files: Auto-delete after 7 days
</Callout>

<DevTip title="S3 Intelligent-Tiering">
If access patterns are unpredictable, use **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**. It automatically moves objects to the appropriate storage class to optimize costs.

```bash
# Set Intelligent-Tiering with CLI
aws s3api put-bucket-intelligent-tiering-configuration \
  --bucket my-app-storage-2026 \
  --id EntireBucket \
  --intelligent-tiering-configuration file://tiering.json
```
</DevTip>

## Next Steps

You've completed S3 bucket setup! Try these next:

- **Integrate with Lambda**: Trigger Lambda functions with S3 events
- **Connect with CloudFront**: Deliver content globally via CDN
- **Enable Versioning**: Track and restore file changes
- **Set up Encryption**: Protect data with server-side encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS)
- **Use S3 SDK**: Programmatic access with Python boto3 or Node.js AWS SDK

<CopyBlock language="python" title="Using S3 with Python boto3">
```python
import boto3

# Create S3 client
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

# Upload file
s3.upload_file('local-file.txt', 'my-app-storage-2026', 'uploaded-file.txt')

# Download file
s3.download_file('my-app-storage-2026', 'uploaded-file.txt', 'downloaded-file.txt')

# List files
response = s3.list_objects_v2(Bucket='my-app-storage-2026')
for obj in response.get('Contents', []):
    print(obj['Key'])
```
</CopyBlock>

<CopyBlock language="javascript" title="Using S3 with Node.js AWS SDK">
```javascript
const { S3Client, PutObjectCommand, GetObjectCommand } = require('@aws-sdk/client-s3');
const fs = require('fs');

const s3Client = new S3Client({ region: 'ap-northeast-2' });

// Upload file
async function uploadFile() {
  const fileContent = fs.readFileSync('local-file.txt');

  const command = new PutObjectCommand({
    Bucket: 'my-app-storage-2026',
    Key: 'uploaded-file.txt',
    Body: fileContent
  });

  await s3Client.send(command);
  console.log('File uploaded successfully');
}

uploadFile();
```
