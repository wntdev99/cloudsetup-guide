## What is a Project?

<Callout type="info">
📦 **Projects are containers for resources**

A GCP project serves these purposes:
- **Resource grouping**: Manage VMs, databases, storage as one unit
- **Access control**: Grant team members permissions per project
- **Cost tracking**: View costs separately by project
- **API management**: Enable APIs independently per project

Examples:
- `my-blog-project`: For blog website
- `ai-experiment`: For AI/ML experiments
- `company-website`: For company homepage
</Callout>

<Step number={2} title="Enter Project Information">

### 2-1. Project Name

1. Enter your desired name in the **Project name** field.
   - Example: "My First GCP Project"

   - Example: "Personal Blog"

<Callout type="info">
✨ **Project Name vs Project ID**

- **Project name**: Human-readable name (can be changed)
- **Project ID**: Globally unique identifier (cannot be changed)

<DevTip>
**Project ID Selection Tips**

- Only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens (-)
- 6-30 characters
- Must be globally unique (red warning if already taken)
- Cannot be changed after creation
- Choose something memorable

Examples:
- `my-first-gcp-2024` ✅
- `ai-experiments-john` ✅
- `MyProject123` ❌ (no uppercase)
</DevTip>

### 2-3. Organization (Optional)

- **Organization**: Select if you have a company/team, otherwise "No organization"

### Verify Billing Account Connection

After creating your project, verify the billing account is linked:

1. Click **Billing** in the left menu
2. If you see "This project has no billing account":
   - Click **LINK A BILLING ACCOUNT**
   - Select your free trial account
   - Click **SET ACCOUNT**

<Callout type="warning">
⚠️ **APIs won't work without a billing account**

Most GCP services require a linked billing account to function. Even with free credits, you must link a billing account.
</Callout>

<Checkpoint
  title="Verify Project Creation"
  items={[
    "Is your new project name shown at the top?",
    "Can you see project information in the dashboard?",
    "Is the billing account linked?"
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="success">
✅ **Congratulations!** Your first GCP project is created. You can now enable APIs and use services!
</Callout>

</Step>

## Explore the Project Dashboard

After creating your project, you'll see a dashboard showing:

<CopyBlock
  code="Project Dashboard includes:

📊 Project Information
  - Project name
  - Project ID
  - Project number

📈 Resource Monitoring
  - Currently running resources
  - API usage
  - Errors and logs

💰 Billing Information

## Next Steps

Now that you have a project, start using GCP services:

1. **[Vision API Setup](../gcp-vision-api-setup)** - Enable image analysis API
2. **[Translation API Setup](../gcp-translation-api-setup)** - Try the translation API
3. **[Cloud Storage Setup](../gcp-cloud-storage-setup)** - Create file storage

## Project Management Tips

### Creating Multiple Projects

Separate projects by purpose:

```
Personal Project Structure Example:

📦 learning-gcp (Learning)
  - Vision API experiments
  - Cloud Functions tests

📦 personal-blog (Blog)
  - Cloud Run web server
  - Cloud Storage

📦 side-project (Side Project)
  - Firestore DB
  - Cloud Functions
```

### Switching Between Projects

To quickly switch between projects:
1. Click the project dropdown at the top
2. Select desired project
3. Keyboard shortcut: Type project name in search

## Project Naming Best Practices

<Callout type="tip">
📝 **Choosing Good Project Names**

**Name (for humans)**:
- Clear and descriptive: "My AI Project" ✅
- Avoid vague names: "Project 1" ❌

**ID (for systems)**:
- Include environment: `myapp-dev`, `myapp-prod`
- Include date: `learning-gcp-2024`
- Include team/person: `blog-john`
- Keep it short: `ai-exp` ✅ vs `artificial-intelligence-experiments-project` ❌

Examples:
- `learning-gcp-2024` (for learning)
- `portfolio-prod` (portfolio production)
- `blog-dev` (blog development)
- `ai-research-personal` (personal AI research)
</Callout>
