</Callout>

<DevTip title="Region Selection Guide">
**Available Major Regions:**
- Northeast Asia (Seoul): For Korean users
- Southeast Asia (Singapore): For Southeast Asian users

**Selection Criteria:**
- Choose the region where your primary users are located
- Region selection is more important for latency-sensitive applications
- For global services, you can use Edge Functions for region-specific caching later
</DevTip>

<Checkpoint>
- [ ] Project name entered
- [ ] Database password generated and saved
- [ ] Region selected
- [ ] Project creation completed (green checkmark visible)
</Checkpoint>

</Step>

<Step number={4} title="Explore the Dashboard">

Once project creation is complete, the dashboard will be displayed.

- Next guide: [Supabase Database Setup Guide](../supabase-database-setup)

**SQL Editor** 💻
- Write and execute SQL queries directly
- Perform complex database operations
- Manage saved queries

**Authentication** 🔐
- Configure and manage user authentication
- Supports various authentication methods: email, OAuth, magic links, etc.
- Next guide: [Supabase Auth Setup Guide](../supabase-auth-setup)

**Storage** 📁
- Upload and manage files
- Store images, videos, documents, etc.
- Next guide: [Supabase Storage Setup Guide](../supabase-storage-setup)

### Check API Keys in Project Settings

1. Click **Project Settings** (gear icon) in the bottom left
2. Select the **API** menu
3. You can view the following information:

   **Project URL**: Your project's API endpoint
   ```
   https://xxxxxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co
   ```

   **API Keys**:
   - `anon public`: Public key used in clients (browser, mobile app)
   - `service_role`: Secret key used only on servers (never expose to clients)

<Screenshot
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/v1234567890/guides/supabase-account-setup/step4-api-keys-en.png"
  alt="Check Supabase API keys"
  caption="View project URL and API keys in Project Settings > API"
/>

<Callout type="warning">
**Never include the service_role key in client code!** This key bypasses all RLS (Row Level Security) policies, so exposing it on GitHub or in browser-executed code creates security risks.
</Callout>

<DevTip title="API Key Usage Guide">
**anon public key:**
- Used in frontend code (React, Vue, Next.js, etc.)
- Protected by RLS policies
- Relatively safe to upload to public repositories (but environment variables recommended)

**service_role key:**
- Only use in backend code (API Routes, serverless functions)
- Can access all data (admin privileges)
- Must manage with environment variables (.env.local)
- Never commit to Git

**Environment Variable Example:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGc...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGc... # Server-side only
```
</DevTip>

- [ ] Project URL checked and saved
- [ ] anon public key checked and saved
- [ ] service_role key checked and saved (stored securely)

2. The project will resume within a few minutes
3. All data is preserved

<Callout type="tip">
To prevent your project from being paused, periodically access the dashboard or set up a simple health check that calls the API.
