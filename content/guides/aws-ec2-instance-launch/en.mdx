# Launch AWS EC2 Instance

AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides virtual servers in the cloud. This guide walks you through launching an EC2 instance and connecting to it via SSH.

<FreeTierInfo
  limit="750 hours/month (t2.micro or t3.micro)"
  period="12 months"
  conditions={[
    "Available for new AWS accounts for 12 months",
    "Only t2.micro or t3.micro instances eligible",

The EC2 dashboard shows your running instances, volumes, Elastic IPs, and other resources at a glance.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Select AMI and Configure Instance Type">

Choose an operating system image (AMI) and configure the instance type.

### Name and AMI Selection

1. In **Name and tags** section, enter an instance name (e.g., `my-web-server`)
2. In **Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)** section, select an OS:
   - Recommended: **Amazon Linux 2023 AMI** (check for Free tier eligible label)
   - Or choose **Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS**

  alt="AMI selection screen"
  caption="Select a Free tier eligible AMI"
/>

### Instance Type Selection

3. In **Instance type** section, select **t2.micro** or **t3.micro**:
   - t2.micro: 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM (Free tier)
   - t3.micro: 2 vCPU, 1GB RAM (Free tier)

  alt="Instance type selection"
  caption="Choose t2.micro or t3.micro for Free tier eligibility"
/>

<DevTip title="Instance Type Selection Tips">
- **t2.micro**: Most common Free tier option, stable performance
- **t3.micro**: Better CPU performance, improved burst credit system
- For development/testing, t3.micro is recommended
</DevTip>

</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Create Key Pair and Configure Network">

Create a key pair for SSH access and configure network settings.

### Create Key Pair

1. In **Key pair (login)** section, click **Create new key pair**
2. Enter a key pair name (e.g., `my-ec2-key`)
3. Select key pair type:
   - Choose **RSA** (recommended)
4. Private key file format:
   - Linux/Mac: Select **.pem**
   - Windows (PuTTY): Select **.ppk**
5. Click **Create key pair** button

  alt="Key pair creation"
  caption="Create and download a key pair for SSH access"
/>

<Callout type="warning">
Store the downloaded key pair file (.pem or .ppk) in a safe location. This file cannot be downloaded again, and you won't be able to access your instance without it.
</Callout>

### Network Settings

6. In **Network settings** section, use the default VPC
7. Set **Auto-assign public IP** to **Enable**

<Checkpoint
  items={[
    "Did you download the key pair file (.pem)?",
    "Is auto-assign public IP enabled?"
  ]}
/>

</Step>

<Step number={4} title="Configure Security Groups">

Set up firewall rules (security groups) for your instance.

### Basic Security Group Configuration

1. In **Firewall (security groups)** section, select **Create security group**
2. Security group name: `my-web-server-sg`
3. Description: `Security group for web server`

### Add Inbound Rules

By default, an SSH rule is added. Add additional rules for web servers:

4. Click **Add security group rule** button to add these rules:

| Type | Protocol | Port Range | Source | Description |
|------|----------|------------|--------|-------------|
| SSH | TCP | 22 | My IP | SSH access (auto-added) |
| HTTP | TCP | 80 | 0.0.0.0/0 | Web server (optional) |
| HTTPS | TCP | 443 | 0.0.0.0/0 | Secure web server (optional) |

  alt="Security group configuration"
  caption="Configure security group rules for SSH and web server access"
/>

<Callout type="danger">
**Security Best Practices:**
- Restrict SSH (port 22) to "My IP" whenever possible
- Allowing all IPs (0.0.0.0/0) increases security risks
- Only open necessary ports, keep unused ports closed
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step number={5} title="Configure Storage and Launch Instance">

Configure storage settings and launch the instance.

### Storage Configuration

1. In **Configure storage** section:
   - Volume size: **8 GiB** ~ **30 GiB** (Free tier: up to 30GB)
   - Volume type: **gp3** (General Purpose SSD, recommended) or **gp2**
   - **Delete on termination**: Check (for test instances)

  alt="Storage configuration"
  caption="Configure storage within Free tier limits"
/>

### Advanced Details (Optional)

2. Expand **Advanced details** for additional settings (use defaults for most cases)

### Review and Launch

3. Review your configuration in the **Summary** panel on the right
4. Click **Launch instance** button

<Screenshot

  alt="Launch instance"
  caption="Review all settings and launch the instance"
/>

5. You'll see "Successfully initiated launch of instance" message
6. Click **View instances** button to go to the instances list

<Callout type="info">
It takes 1-2 minutes for the instance to start and reach running state. Wait for status checks to complete.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step number={6} title="Connect to Instance via SSH">

Connect to your newly created instance using SSH.

### Check Public IP

1. Select your instance from the instances list
2. In the **Details** tab below, find and copy the **Public IPv4 address**

  alt="Check public IP"
  caption="Find the instance's public IP address"
/>

### SSH Connection (Linux/Mac)

3. Open Terminal and set key pair file permissions:

<CopyBlock language="bash">
chmod 400 ~/Downloads/my-ec2-key.pem
</CopyBlock>

4. Connect via SSH:

<CopyBlock language="bash">
ssh -i ~/Downloads/my-ec2-key.pem ec2-user@YOUR_PUBLIC_IP
</CopyBlock>

**Username reference:**
- Amazon Linux: `ec2-user`
- Ubuntu: `ubuntu`
- Debian: `admin`

  alt="SSH connection success"
  caption="Successfully connected to EC2 instance via SSH"
/>

### SSH Connection (Windows - PuTTY)

For Windows users with PuTTY:

1. Launch PuTTY
2. **Host Name**: Enter `ec2-user@YOUR_PUBLIC_IP`
3. Navigate to **Connection → SSH → Auth → Credentials** and select your .ppk file
4. Click **Open** button to connect

### Allocate Elastic IP (Optional)

When you stop and restart an instance, the public IP changes. For a static IP:

5. Click **Network & Security → Elastic IPs** in the left menu
6. Click **Allocate Elastic IP address** button
7. Click **Allocate** button
8. Select the allocated IP and click **Actions → Associate Elastic IP address**
9. Select your instance and click **Associate** button

<Callout type="warning">
Elastic IPs are free when associated with a running instance, but you're charged hourly for unassociated Elastic IPs.
</Callout>

<Checkpoint
  items={[
    "Can you connect to the instance via SSH successfully?",
    "Does the instance show 'running' status?",
    "Have you allocated an Elastic IP if needed?"
  ]}
/>

</Step>

## Next Steps

You've successfully launched an EC2 instance! Here's what you can do next:

- [AWS RDS Database Setup](/guides/aws-rds-setup) - Create a managed database
- [AWS CloudWatch Monitoring Setup](/guides/aws-cloudwatch-setup) - Set up instance monitoring and alarms

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Connect via SSH

1. **Check Security Group**: Verify SSH (port 22) is open
2. **Key Pair Permissions**: Ensure permissions are set with `chmod 400`
3. **Check Username**: Use the correct username for your AMI
4. **Network Check**: Verify public IP is assigned

### Instance Won't Start

1. **Instance Limits**: Check if you've exceeded account instance limits
2. **Region Check**: Ensure you're working in the correct region
3. **Status Checks**: Review system and instance status checks

### Worried About Free Tier Overages

1. **Billing Dashboard**: Regularly check Free tier usage
2. **CloudWatch Alarms**: Set up billing alarms to prevent budget overruns
3. **Stop Instance**: Stop (not terminate) instances when not in use

<Callout type="tip">
Stopping an instance eliminates compute charges but EBS storage charges continue. To completely remove charges, terminate the instance.
