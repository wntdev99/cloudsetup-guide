💳 **Why do I need a credit card?**

GCP requires credit card information to verify you're a real person, not a bot. However, **you will NOT be automatically charged**. When your free credits run out or after 90 days, services will automatically stop, and you won't be charged unless you manually upgrade to a paid account.

- Contact Google support or create a new account with a different Google account
