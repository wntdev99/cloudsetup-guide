## Why Do You Need Budget Alerts?

<Callout type="warning">
⚠️ **Accidental costs can add up quickly**

GCP is a powerful cloud platform, but mistakes like leaving resources running or misconfiguration can drain your credits rapidly. Budget alerts help you:
- Get automatic email notifications at 50%, 80%, and 100% credit usage
- Detect unexpected spending early
- Take action before credits are exhausted
